  "root": (<p>This tool was created for organizations to record security incidents.  It is based upon the Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS). It is designed to collect information about security incidents experienced, investigated, or otherwise handled by your organization. VERIS defines an incident as any deliberate or accidental event that results in the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of any type of information asset. Anything meeting that definition can be recorded using this tool. Incidents are recorded on an 'incident-by-incident' basis rather than in aggregate. In other words, each response represents a single incident. Refer to the <a href='www.veriscommunity.net'>VERIS Community site</a> for additional clarification around questions and options. Each section has a More Info link that will take you to the appropriate section in the VERIS wiki.<br /><br />The tool itself is fairly self-explanatory and similar to any other online form. One tip worth mentioning is that holding CTRL or COMMAND lets you select multiple items from a list if that option is available. Please contact us with any issues or questions at dbir@verizon.com.<br /><br />Records created with this tool can be submitted to the <a href='http://www.verizonenterprise.com/verizon-insights-lab/dbir/2017/' target='_blank'>Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)</a> if you so choose.  Please remember not to enter any victim-identifying or highly-sensitive information into this form as we want all data from the DBIR to be anonymous.</p>),
