Version 1.3.3
=============
18-11-29

VERIS has been updated to version 1.3.3.  This mostly contains enumeration additions, but has some which affect parsing. 

For example, 'discovery_method' was previously a flat list.  It is now an object of the form discovery_method.<internal/external/partner>.variety.<enum>.  Additionally, several implicit hierarchies have bene formalized in rules.py.

Additionally some under-used fields have been merged with others or removed. See the conversion script for exactly what's happening.

Additionally, almost all tooling has been updated for python3.  This may cause issues as python2 limportlib does not work the same as post python3.6 importlib.  mergeschema.py must still be run as python2 currently as python3 is not able to serialize the ordereddict (used to keep the schema files in a certain order).



Version 1.3
===========

Schema changes
--------------

 * Schema has been documented using ietf.org draft 4 specifications: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fge-json-schema-validation-00
 * Add new actor.internal.job_change field (see enumerations below)
 * Changes asset.country to an array so that we can model assets that exist in multiple countries.
 * Changes victim.country to an array rather than a string.
 * Adds a discovery_notes field to describe the discovery in greater detail.
 * Removes asset.management, asset.hosting, asset.ownership, and asset.accessibility 
 * Added asset.governance. This is intended to capture interesting facts about the management of the asset but is not intended to be all-inclusive or apply to all assets. E.g. there would be no selection if a person was the affected asset.
 * Removes the existing physical.vector enumeration and renames physical.location to physical.vector. Some of the values from the old physical.vector are now in physical.variety.
 * Adds new attribute.confidentiality.data_victim (see enumerations below)
 * Adds six character region array to actor.external, actor.partner, and victim.
 * Adds actor.external.name, an array of strings used to identify the actor such as 'Syrian Electronic Army' or 'Zero Cool'.
 * Renames the related_incidents field to campaign_id

attribute (C/P, I/A, A/U) of an asset was compromised).
