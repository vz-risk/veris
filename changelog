Version 1.3
===========

Schema changes
--------------

 * Schema has been documented using ietf.org draft 4 specifications: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fge-json-schema-validation-00
 * Add new actor.internal.job_change field (see enumerations below)
 * Changes asset.country to an array so that we can model assets that exist in multiple countries.
 * Changes victim.country to an array rather than a string.
 * Adds a discovery_notes field to describe the discovery in greater detail.
 * Removes asset.management, asset.hosting, asset.ownership, and asset.accessibility 
 * Added asset.governance. This is intended to capture interesting facts about the management of the asset but is not intended to be all-inclusive or apply to all assets. E.g. there would be no selection if a person was the affected asset.
 * Removes the existing physical.vector enumeration and renames physical.location to physical.vector. Some of the values from the old physical.vector are now in physical.variety.
 * Adds new attribute.confidentiality.data_victim (see enumerations below)
 * Adds six character region array to actor.external, actor.partner, and victim.
 * Adds actor.external.name, an array of strings used to identify the actor such as 'Syrian Electronic Army' or 'Zero Cool'.

attribute (C/P, I/A, A/U) of an asset was compromised).

(kiosk/public facing user device)
