  "summary": "Already this year, there have been three episodes \u2013 look here, here and here. This latest, however, isn\u2019t due to a lapse in the drugmaker\u2019s systems, but can be traced to the company that provides cars to Pfizer employees, such as the sales reps. Last week, Wheels sent letters to about 1,800 Pfizer spouses and domestic partners saying there was a \u201ctemporary encryption error in the security system of a web site Wheels Inc was using to collect data.\u201d  As a result, personal info was \u201cbriefly transmitted over the Internet in an unsecured manner.\u201d What kind of info? Names, addresses, date of birth and driver\u2019s license numbers. The info was to have been used for background checks in order for spouses or domestic partners of Pfizer employees to be eligible to drive the leased company car, Stratford Dick, Wheels\u2019 marketing director told Pharmalot.  But he insists Wheels took \u201cimmediate steps to ensure that the data encryption was implemented appropriately.\u201d There was no breach of Wheels website, he adds, and there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that any of the unencrypted information was misused in any way. As a precautionary measure, the leasing company is offering two years of credit protection and credit restoration services free of charge. Whether that will please Pfizer employees remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Dick says a review of Wheels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data-collection systems has been conducted to ensure that this situation doesn\u2019t occur again. ",
