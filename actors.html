                            <p>There can be more than one actor involved in any particular incident, and their actions can be malicious or non-malicious, intentional or unintentional, causal or contributory. VERIS recognizes three primary categories of threat actors - External, Internal, and Partner.</p>
<p>

<i>VERIS classification note: If the actor’s role in the breach is limited to a contributory error, the actor would not be included here. For example, if an insider’s unintentional misconfiguration of an application left it vulnerable to attack, the insider would not be considered a threat actor if the application were successfully breached by another actor. An insider who deliberately steals data or whose inappropriate behavior (e.g., policy violations) facilitated the breach would be considered a threat actor in the breach.</i>

                                <p>External threats originate from sources outside of the organization and its network of partners. Examples include criminal groups, lone hackers, former employees, and government entities. Also includes God (as in “acts of”), “Mother Nature,” and random chance. Typically, no trust or privilege is implied for external entities.</p>

                                <p><b>Miscellaneous: </b>Reserving this for the actor's origin and collecting IPs separately allows the best of both worlds. We can track both the origin (and national ties) of threat actors and the location of the assets they use for malicious purposes./p>

                                <h4>Industry</h4>

                                <p><b>Question Text: </b>Which industry best describes the services provided by the partner(s)?</p>
                                <p><b>User notes: </b>If multiple, chose the option most closely associated with the partner services involved in the incident. VERIS uses standard NAIC codes for this list of industries. If you would like to enter a more specific code (e.g., full 6 digits), select the “other” option, and enter the desired code. NAICS provides descriptions at http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/sssd/naics/naicsrch?chart=2012.</p>
                                <p><b>Question type: </b>text field or enumerated list (single-select)</p>
                                <p><b>Variable name: </b><i>actor.partner.industry</i> (string)</p>
                                <p><b>Purpose: </b>Identifying the partner's industry (or the services provided) helps to assess and manage risk in dealing with 3rd parties.</p>
                                <p><b>Developer notes: </b>We recommend making it as easy as possible for the user to locate and select the appropriate industry code (e.g., a picklist). If appropriate, auto-populate this field rather than prompting the user for it. The application should be configured to require at least 3 digits of the full 6 digit code in order to provide sufficient specificity.</p>
                                <p><b>Miscellaneous: </b>N/A</p>

                                <h4>Origin (country)</h4>

                                <p><b>Question Text: </b>What is the partner's country of operation?</p>
                                <p><b>User notes: </b>If multinational, select the primary location of the business group involved in the incident.</p>
                                <p><b>Question type: </b><a href="enums.html#section-repeated">enumerated list</a> (multi-select)</p>
                                <p><b>Variable name: </b><i>actor.partner.country</i> (string)</p>
                                <p><b>Purpose: </b>Identifies the geographic origin of the actor, which is useful on multiple investigatory, operational, and strategic levels.</p>
                                <p><b>Developer notes: </b>VERIS uses the ISO 3166 codes for the country variable, which can be found here: http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes.htm. We recommend creating a list in the interface rather than requiring users to enter the correct code.</p>
