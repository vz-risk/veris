                                Getting Started with VERIS
                            </h2>

                            <p>VERIS can be a little bit intimidating to look at.
                            The important thing to remember is that the
                            framework can be as simple or as complicated as you
                            need for it to be. There are very few required fields
                            in a VERIS record and many of them are only required
                            if a particular attribute is present. For example,
                            hacking variety is only required if hacking was
                            present in the incident. Furthermore, nearly all
                            of the required fields allow for unknowns. As an
                            example, here is the simplest VERIS record that can
                            exist:</p>

                            <table border=1>
                              <tr><th>Variable</th><th>Value</th></tr>
                              <tr><td>timeline.incident.year</td><td>2014</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>schema_version</td><td>1.3</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>incident_id</td><td>1</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>security_incident</td><td>Confirmed</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>discovery_method</td><td>Unknown</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>action</td><td>Unknown</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>asset</td><td>Unknown</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>actor</td><td>Unknown</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>attribute</td><td>Unknown</td></tr>
                            </table>

                            <p>That's not bad. You don't have to use every
                              feature and you don't have to put your incidents
                              into the JSON format that we have documented. The
                              JSON format makes it easier to share incidents
                              with other companies and validate your records,
                              but you can work your way up to that. </p>

                            <p>To help you work your way up to that, we've put
                              together some guidelines to help you ease your
                              way into using VERIS internally.</p>

                            <h2 class="section-title">
                              Start with what you have
                            </h2>

                            <p>You're probably recording security incidents in
                              your organization some way right now. Maybe it
                              is in your help-desk ticketing system or maybe
                              you have a unique system just for security. Maybe
                              you store free-text Word documents with a narrative
                              of what happened.</p>

                            <p>When you have an incient you probably record the
                              date that it happened. Take the day, week, and
                              month and just give them VERIS labels.</p>

                            <table  border=1>
                              <tr><th>Variable</th><th>Value</th></tr>
                              <tr><td>timeline.incident.year</td><td>2014</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>timeline.incident.month</td><td>08</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>timeline.incident.day</td><td>04</td></tr>
                            </table>

                            <p>And you probably have an executive summary of
                              what happened in the incident too.</p>

                            <table border=1>
                              <tr><th>Variable</th><th>Value</th></tr>
                              <tr><td>summary</td><td>Something bad happened.</td></tr>
                            </table>

                            <p>You might have some notes about how you
                              discovered the incident. Or notes about any hacking,
                              malware, social engineering that was observed. Even if
                              this is free-text information, you can record it
                              using VERIS fields.</p>

                            <table border=1>
                              <tr><th>Variable</th><th>Value</th></tr>
                              <tr><td>discovery.notes</td><td>Reported by Frank in accounting.</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>hacking.notes</td><td>accessed server using stolen credentials.</td></tr>
                              <tr><td>social.notes</td><td>Frank received a phishing message and he responded with his password.</td></tr>
                            </table>

                            <p>For all of these you just need to figure out how
                              you're going to gather the information from your
                              existing tracking system and make it easy to find.
                              If you're using free-text Word documents then you
                              might decide to put a table at the top or bottom
                              of the document and fill this in. If your data is
                              in a database you might create another table for
                              security incidents and have a small program that
                              pulls from the database, modifies the data as
                              needed and writes it into your VERIS table.

                            <h2 class="section-title">
                              Add top-level enumerations
                            </h2>
                            <p>Once you've started to extract
                              information from your incidents it's time to start
                              adding in the enumerations that make data analysis
                              easy. There are two required top-level enumerations
                              in VERIS: whether or not this was an actual
                              security incident and how it was discovered.</p>
                            <p>Nearly every help desk ticketing system will allow
                              you to add new fields to your input form, so it could
                              be as simple as creating a dropdown called discovery_method
                              and populating it with the
                              <a href="enums.html#section-incident_desc">discovery_method enumerations.</a>
                              You can do the same with the security_incident field.
                              And of course if you're using a Word document or an
                              Excel spreadsheet just add another column for that variable.</p>
                           <p>It gets a bit trickier when you are already using a set
                             of enumerations for these variables in your organization.
                             You will have to create a mapping between what you use
                             and the appropriate VERIS enumeration. You could
                             decide to adopt the VERIS enumerations and revise
                             previous incidents or you could try to use both sets of
                             enumerations side-by-side. Another helpful option is
                             to continue using your enumerations for these variables
                             but convert them to the VERIS variable when sharing or
                             analyzing the incident.</p>

                          <h2 class="section-title">
                            Add second-level enumerations
                          </h2>

                          <p>Now we're going to start to add more detail to the
                            incident by going into the second-level enumerations.
                            There are four top level enumerations that we didn't
                            discuss in the last section: actor, action, asset, and
                            attribute. It doesn't really make sense to have an
                            enumeration for these because VERIS assumes that every
                            incident has one of each of those. So instead we're going
                            to go down a level and use a simple True/False for the
                            second-level enumerations. For each of the following
                            questions just answer Yes/No.

                            <h3>Actors</h3>
                            <table border=1>

                          <p>Let's now imagine a fairly complex espionage incident. Last month an external
                            actor used a phishing message to one of your users convincing him to run an
                            attachment. The attachment installed malware which recorded
                            the user's password. The attacker used those credentials to
                            log into a server and create a backdoor. The backdoor was used
                            to exfiltrate sensitive documents. Later a reporter contacted
                            you and told you that your documents were showing up on an
                            underground forum which lead you to investigate.</p>
                          <p>Using just what we've done so far, what kind of information
                            can we record about the incident?</p>

                          <p>That is a really good VERIS record. Anyone on the
                            VERIS Community Database project would be happy to
                            get a record with that level of detail in it. And
                            really, you haven't done anything hard yet. But you
                            can start to develop trends around how many of your
                            incidents involve physical actions (theft) versus
                            error actions (loss) and how often a phishing email
                            leads to compromised data. You can stop here and
                            probably have better analytics than most organizations.
                            VERIS doesn't have to be complicated.</p>


                          <h2 class="section-title">
                            Customize and privatize
                          </h2>
                          <p>VERIS was designed with sharing in mind, but not
                            everything you want to record is fit for sharing. You
                            might also have some extra things that you want to
                            record but for which a VERIS variable does not exist.
                            Not to worry, VERIS has you covered with the plus section.</p>
                          <p>Plus is the anything goes section of a VERIS record.
                            So, for example, you might want to track which of your
                            employees was the lead investigator on an incident.
                            No problem, just make a record called plus.investigator or
                            plus.lead or whatever you want to call it. You can have
                            a variable for whether or not the incident is resolved. You
                            could put information in there that does have an associated VERIS
                            varible but which you would like to keep private anyway.</p>
                          <p>When you share the incident (should you ever decide to) you
                            can leave out any variable that starts with "plus." If
                            you're sharing a JSON representation of an incident, you can
                            leave out plus all together or just send an empty plus
                            section ("plus":{}).</p>


                          <h2 class="section-title">
                            Add more detail
                          </h2>
                          <p>At this point your VERIS records are looking really
                            good. You've got the basic details of what happened,
                            and you're probably already starting to extract useful
                            trends from the data. Now it's time to turn the volume
                            up to 11 and start getting more detailed information.</p>
                          <p>If you have hacking in an incident it follows that you
                            might want to know what kind of hacking. After all,
                            hacking is a really big word that means a lot of things
                            to different people. All seven of the threat actions
                            have a subvariable named "variety" and most also have
                            a variable named "vector". These will help you describe
                            the kind of hacking that you're dealing with in a
                            format that still lends itself well to analysis.</p>
                          <p>If you have an incident caused by an internal threat
                            actor, you might want want to know what motivated
                            the employee to act. Maybe you want to track what kind
                            of employee it was or whether there had been any recent
                            job change action. All of the actor variable have subvariables
                            for variety and motive.</p>
                          <p>You might also want to record how long it took you to
                            discover the incident and how much the incident impacted
                            your organization. VERIS has variables for that too.</p>
                          <p>Let's VERISize another fictitious scenario with all the
                            new variables we've added. In this case, you're notified
                            by the local police department that an employeee in
                            billing was arrested during a raid on an identity theft
                            ring and is suspected of stealing identities from your
                            company. You paid a forensic company $14,121 for an investigation which revealed that the
                            employee had been accessing customer records without
                            cause for three months. You also paid $8,000 to a law firm
                            to make appropriate notification to the Attorney General in your state. Here is what the incident might
                            look like in VERIS.</p>

                          <p>You can keep adding variables for all the parts of VERIS
                            that you want to make use of and you can get really complicated
                            models of a security incident. But all through this HOWTO
                            we have been creating valid VERIS records which are only as
                            complicated as the organization is willing to record.</p>


                          <h2 class="section-title">
                            Anonymize yourself and share
                          </h2>
                          <p>When you're using VERIS internally you might not care
                            about victim demographics since your organization is
                            going to be the only victim. But if you want to share
                            this data with other organizations then it is helpful to know
                            about the victim organization. VERIS makes it easy to
                            share the relevant information without revealing the
                            organization's name.</p>
                          <p>For example, VERIS records the country, industry, and
                            industry of the victim organization. VERIS also has
                            variables for the organization's employee count, revenue,
                            and state (if in the U.S.). This is information that is
                            useful for correlating impact with company size or for
                            identifying which attack patterns affect industries but
                            don't identify the company.</p>
                          <div class="well">
                            VERIS has a victim_id field which is used in the VERIS
                            Community Database to name the victim organization. This
                            is not a required field in VERIS and organizations sharing
                            data with VERIS may choose to omit this field.</div>
